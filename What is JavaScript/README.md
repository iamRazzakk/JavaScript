## 1. What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is multi-paradigm, single-threaded, and dynamic. JavaScript is widely used for building dynamic and interactive web pages.

## 2. History of JavaScript
JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich and was first announced in 1995. Over the years, it has become one of the most popular programming languages and is essential for web development.

## 3. Versions (ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, ES6)
JavaScript has gone through several versions, each introducing new features and improvements. The major versions include ES1 (ECMAScript 1), ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015). Subsequent versions, such as ES7, ES8, and so on, continue to enhance the language.

## 4. Var
The `var` keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. However, it is now considered outdated, and modern best practices favor using `let` and `const` for variable declarations. `var` has function-level scope and can lead to unexpected behavior, so it's recommended to use `let` and `const` for better code maintainability and clarity.

```javascript
// Example with var (not recommended)
var exampleVar = "This is a variable.";
