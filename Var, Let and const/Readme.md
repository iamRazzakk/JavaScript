# Var
The `var` keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. However, it is now considered outdated, and modern best practices favor using `let` and `const` for variable declarations. `var` has function-level scope and can lead to unexpected behavior, so it's recommended to use `let` and `const` for better code maintainability and clarity.


## Syntax
 var exampleVar = "Hello Good People";

# Let
`Let` also use for variables in javaScript.`Let` declaration declares re-assignable ,block-scope local variables.
## Syntax
let goodPeople = 'kind';
let goodPeople = 'honest';
console.log(goodPeople);
outPut:honest



# Const
`const` also use for variable in javaScript.`Const` can't re-declare, block-scope.
## Syntax
const goodPeople = 'kind';
const goodPeople = 'honest';
