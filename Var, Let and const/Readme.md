## 4. Var
The `var` keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. However, it is now considered outdated, and modern best practices favor using `let` and `const` for variable declarations. `var` has function-level scope and can lead to unexpected behavior, so it's recommended to use `let` and `const` for better code maintainability and clarity.


# Syntax
 <!-- var exampleVar = "Hello Good People"; -->

## 5. Let
`Let` also use for variables in javaScript.`Let` declaration declares re-assignable ,block-scope local variables.
# Syntax
<!-- let goodPeople = 'kind';
let goodPeople = 'honest';
let goodPeople = 'compassionate'; -->
